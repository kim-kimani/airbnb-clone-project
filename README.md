## üìã Features Overview

### 1. API Documentation
- **OpenAPI Standard**: APIs are documented using OpenAPI for clarity and easy integration.
- **Django REST Framework**: Used to build RESTful APIs for CRUD operations on users, properties, and bookings.
- **GraphQL**: Provides a flexible query mechanism for efficient data fetching and manipulation.

### 2. User Authentication
- **Endpoints**: `/users/`, `/users/{user_id}/`
- **Features**: Register new users, authenticate, manage profiles, and update account details.

### 3. Property Management
- **Endpoints**: `/properties/`, `/properties/{property_id}/`
- **Features**: Hosts can create, update, retrieve, and delete property listings.

### 4. Booking System
- **Endpoints**: `/bookings/`, `/bookings/{booking_id}/`
- **Features**: Users can make, update, and manage their bookings including check-in/check-out dates.

### 5. Payment Processing
- **Endpoints**: `/payments/`
- **Features**: Handles secure transactions related to each booking.

### 6. Review System
- **Endpoints**: `/reviews/`, `/reviews/{review_id}/`
- **Features**: Guests can post and manage reviews for properties they've booked.

### 7. Database Optimizations
- **Indexing**: Improves performance by indexing frequently accessed fields.
- **Caching**: Uses Redis to reduce load and improve response times.
